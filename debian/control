Description: LPeg library for the Lua language
 LPeg is a new pattern-matching library for Lua, based on Parsing Expression
 Grammars (PEGs). PEGs look similar to regular expressions or context-free
 grammars in Backus-Naur form (BNF) notation. PEGs make a good replacement for
 regular expressions, because they are strictly more powerful. For example, a
 regular expression inherently cannot find matched pairs of parentheses, because
 it is not recursive, but a PEG can.

 This package contains the development files of the lpeg library,
 useful to create a statically linked binary (like a C application or a
 standalone Lua interpreter).
 Documentation is also shipped within this package.
